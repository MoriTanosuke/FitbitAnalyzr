What is this?
=============

I try to build a web application that fits the need of my own *quantified self* itching. I want to have a good overview of the data I collected with my [Fitbit][http://www.fitbit.com] and the graphs available on the website are not really a beauty.

So I decided to create my own application. You can see it **and use it** at http://fitbitanalyzr.heroku.com.


Continuous Integration
