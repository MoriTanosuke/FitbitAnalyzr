What is this?
=============

I try to build a web application that fits the need of my own *quantified self* itching.
I want to have a good overview of the data I collected with my [Fitbit][0]
and the graphs available on the website are not really a beauty.

So I decided to create my own application. You can see it **and use it** at 
[fitbitanalyzr.heroku.com][1].

Latest Changes
==============

* pagination on all data pages

To see what I want to add next, take a look at [the roadmap][2].

Continuous Integration
======================
